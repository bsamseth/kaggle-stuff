# Data files

The actual data is not under version control (large files). 

## How to get the data

It assumed that you are running in an environment where the `kaggle` script is available (i.e. you have run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell`).

``` bash
> kaggle datasets download anokas/kuzushiji
> unzip kuzushiji.zip  # Run from this `data` folder
```
